= Dynamic Smoother

include::../../common.adoc[]

== Overview

The `dynamic_smoother` class is based on link:https://cytomic.com/files/dsp/DynamicSmoothing.pdf[Dynamic Smoothing Using Self Modulating Filter] (Â© Andrew Simper, Cytomic, 2014, andy@cytomic.com), a robust and inexpensive dynamic smoothing algorithm based on using the bandpass output of a 2-pole multimode filter to modulate its own cutoff frequency. The bandpass signal dynamically adjusts the cutoff frequency to provide faster tracking when the input signal changes significantly. It is ideal for de-noising and smoothing operations, such as for analog potentiometers or MIDI controllers, but is also useful in cleaning up audio signals for analytical processes such as pitch detection.

== Declaration

```c++

                  frequency base
                , float sps
               );

               dynamic_smoother(
                  frequency base
                , float sensitivity
                , float sps
               );

      float    operator()(float s);

=== Notation

`ds`, `a`, `b`    :: Objects of type `dynamic_smoother`.
`f`               :: Object of type `frequency` representing the base cutoff frequency.
`sps`             :: Floating point value representing samples per second.
`sens`            :: Floating point value representing sensitivity.
`s`               :: Input sample.

| Expression                        | Semantics

| `dynamic_smoother(f, sens, sps)`  | Construct a `dynamic_smoother` with specified base
                                      cutoff frequency, `f`, sensitivity, `sens`, and
                                      samples per second, `sps`.
| `dynamic_smoother(f, sps)`        | Construct a `dynamic_smoother` with specified base
                                      cutoff frequency, `f`, and samples per second, `sps`.
                                      In this case, the sensitivity is set to 0.5.
| `dynamic_smoother(b)`             | Copy construct a `dynamic_smoother` from `b`.
| `a = b`                           | Assign `b` to `a`.
